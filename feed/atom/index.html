<li>Title is the Key. Good post always come up with good Title. Readers have the  tendency to click on the story when the title is meaningful. So, do ensure to have a  descriptive and catchy title of 5 to 10 words in length</li>
<li>Do not write the title all in CAPS, which sounds shouting at readers. The  maximum length of title is 80 characters, so you have to be creative to include  as much message as you can within this limit.</li>
<li>Never paste URLs and HTML stuff in the Title as this is annoying to the users. Also, such titles are get flagged easily by users causing  the story to be ineligible to reach hot page.</li>
<li>Do not write keywords repetitively in the Title. Users will not prefer to  read those stories and may get flagged by HumSurfer community. So, generate some  interest in the story with sweet Title and move on to the description.</li>
<li>Write a short summary of what you found interesting in the article. This is  the place where you tell other HumSurfer&#8217;s about your opinion.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Do not just copy paste from the article.</li>
<li>But, to support your opinion, do feel free to quote an interesting sentence or two from the article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
<li>Stories without opinions becomes impersonal and doesn&#8217;t appeal to the  community and are hard to attract conversations from HumSurfer&#8217;s.</li>
<li>&#8220;If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is a worth of  million&#8221;. HumSurfer will take the images and videos from the destination link of  the article and display it for your selection (This part comes in step 3). Do include relevant  images/videos in your post.</li>
